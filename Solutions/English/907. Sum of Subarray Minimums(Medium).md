# 5 Approaches: BF, Three Pointers, TreeMap, Count, DP



[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) [907. Sum of Subarray Minimums](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/).

***By Frank Luo***


Here are **5** approaches to solve this problem.

# Brute Force

## Idea

All elements must be **pushed** in in order. The key is how to pop them out?

Assuming that the value of the current top element of the stack is $1$, and the next value to be popped in the corresponding popped sequence is also $1$, then this value must be popped out immediately. Because the subsequent push will change the top element of the stack to a value other than $2$, so the popped sequence of the popped numbers does not correspond.

Pushes each number in the pushed queue onto the stack, checking to see if the number is the next value to be popped in the popped sequence, and pops it if so.

Finally, check that not all the popped values are popped.

```java
    // BF time: O(n^3) space: O(1)
    // TimeOut
    public static int threeSumMulti_bf(int[] arr, int target) {
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        int len = arr.length;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len - 2; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < len - 1; j++) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < len; k++) {
                    if (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == target) {
                        ans++;
                        ans = ans % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
```

## Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^3)$.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$.


# Three Pointers

Solution $1$ uses $2$ circles and hard to understand.

```java
    public static boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
        if (popped == null || pushed.length <= 1) {
            return true;
        }

        int len = pushed.length;
        int pushIdx = 0;
        int popIdx = 0;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        while (popIdx < len) {
            while (pushIdx < len && pushed[pushIdx] != popped[popIdx]) {
                stack.push(pushed[pushIdx]);
                pushIdx++;
            }

            while (pushIdx < len && popIdx < len && pushed[pushIdx] == popped[popIdx]) {
                pushIdx++;
                popIdx++;
            }

            while (!stack.empty() && popped[popIdx] == stack.peek()) {
                popIdx++;
                stack.pop();
            }

            if (pushIdx == len && popIdx < len && popped[popIdx] != stack.peek()) {
                break;
            }
        }

        if (stack.empty()) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
```

## Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$.


# Solution 3 Using Array

Use the array to realize the function of the stack, and simulate the operation of popping and pushing the stack. **size** represents the size of the stack, and **size-1** is the position of the top of the stack.

Although access is faster, using an array to implement a stack is not recommended in most cases. 

Especially when the pushed array may be very large, the array stack as the stack will also be very large. 

But in fact, there are not many elements in the stack at the same time, which is a great waste.

```java
public boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
    int[] stack = new int[pushed.length];
    int size = 0;
    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < pushed.length; i++) {
        stack[size++] = pushed[i];
        while (size != 0 && stack[size - 1] == popped[j]) {
            size--;j++;
        }
    }
    return size == 0;
}
```

## Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$.


# Solution 4 Optimize Method 3

In fact, we can optimize the Solution $3$, we can find that stack is redundant. 

When traversing the pushed array, $pushed[i]$ is actually the element at the top of the stack. 

At this time, $pushed[i-1]$, $push[i-2]$ ... These positions are already "free", so they are completely The role of stack can be replaced by array push.

```java
    public boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
        int size = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < pushed.length; i++) {
            pushed[size++] = pushed[i];
            while (size != 0 && pushed[size - 1] == popped[j]) {
                size--;
                j++;
            }
        }

        return size == 0;
    }
```

- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$.

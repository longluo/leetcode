***By Long Luo***

# Intuition

Let's use it by **Brute Force** way.

The array $\textit{costs}$ length is $n$, so all the total choices will be $2^n$, that's a really huge number, so we must find a better way!


# Greedy

Obiviously, it's solved by **greedy**. 

We need to **sort** the array $\textit{costs}$ first.

But how to sort it? 

**By what?**

If we choose a person who has lower $cost_A$, but if his $cost_B$ is more lower than another person's $cost_B$, that means the total cost will be larger.

If let $2 \times n$ people all fly to **city B**, then choose $n$ people of them change to fly **city A**, the company need a extra cost $cost_A - cost_B$.

**Ahha**, Eureka! We Got It!

**Sort** the array by $cost_A - cost_B$, the fist $n$ person to **city A**, others go to **city B**.

Let's coding.

```java
    public static int twoCitySchedCost(int[][] costs) {
        int len = costs.length;
        int[][] diff = new int[len][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            diff[i][0] = i;
            diff[i][1] = costs[i][0] - costs[i][1];
        }

        Arrays.sort(diff, (o1, o2) -> {
            if (o1[1] == o2[1]) {
                return o1[0] - o2[0];
            }
            return o1[1] - o2[1];
        });

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
            ans += costs[diff[i][0]][0];
        }

        for (int i = len / 2; i < len; i++) {
            ans += costs[diff[i][0]][1];
        }

        return ans;
    }
```
 
In fact, we don't need an extra array. We can optimize the code.

```java
    public static int twoCitySchedCost_opt(int[][] costs) {
        Arrays.sort(costs, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] o1, int[] o2) {
                return o1[0] - o1[1] - (o2[0] - o2[1]);
            }
        });

        int len = costs.length;
        int n = len / 2;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += costs[i][0] + costs[i + n][1];
        }

        return sum;
    }
```

## Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(nlogn)$.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$.

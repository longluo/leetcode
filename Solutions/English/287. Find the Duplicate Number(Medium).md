[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/).

Here are **9** approaches to solve this problem in Java.

Inspired by @[user2670f](/u/user2670f) and his solution [[C++] 7 Different solutions to this problem (with relaxed constraints)](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/discuss/1894339/C%2B%2B-8-Different-solutions-to-this-problem-or-Do-you-have-another-one)，I added **3** more approaches.

# Brute Force (2 Loops)

Since `solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space`, we can use Brute Force to solve it.

It's easy to use **2 loops** to do it, but the time complexity is `O(n^2)`, so it wouldn't accepted as timeout.

```java
    // 2 Loops
    public static int findDuplicate_2loops(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
                if (nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                    return nums[i];
                }
            }
        }

        return len;
    }
```

# Count
Count the frequency of the num in the array.

With extra `O(n)` space, without modifying the input.

```java
    public static int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int[] cnt = new int[len + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            cnt[nums[i]]++;
            if (cnt[nums[i]] > 1) {
                return nums[i];
            }
        }

        return len;
    }
```

# Hash

Using a `HashSet` to record the occurrence of each number.

With extra `O(n)` space, without modifying the input.

    public static int findDuplicate_set(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        int len = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (!set.add(nums[i])) {
                return nums[i];
            }
        }

# Marking visited value within the array

Since all values of the array are  between `[1..n]` and the array size is `n+1`，while scanning the array from left to right, we set the `nums[n]` to its negative value.

With extra `O(1)` space, with modifying the input.

```java
    // Visited
    public static int findDuplicate_mark(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int idx = Math.abs(num);
            if (nums[idx] < 0) {
                return idx;
            }
            nums[idx] = -nums[idx];
        }

        return len;
    }
```

# Sort

Sorting the array first, then use a loop scanning from `1` to `n`.

With extra `O(logn)` space, with modifying the input.

```java
    public static int findDuplicate_sort(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int len = nums.length;
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
                return nums[i];
            }
        }

        return len;
    }
```

# Index Sort
If the array is sorted, the value of each array element is its index value `index + 1`, then we can do this:

1. If `nums[i] == i + 1`, it means that the order has been sorted, then skip, `i++`;
2. If `nums[i] == nums[nums[i] - 1]`, it means that there is already a value at the correct index, then this value is a duplicated element;
3. If none of the above is satisfied, exchange the values of `nums[i]` and `nums[nums[i] - 1]`.

With extra `O(logn)` space, with modifying the input.

```java
    // Index Sort
    // n + 1 numbers in n.
    public static int findDuplicate_index_sort(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; ) {
            int n = nums[i];
            if (n == i + 1) {
                i++;
            } else if (n == nums[n - 1]) {
                return n;
            } else {
                nums[i] = nums[n - 1];
                nums[n - 1] = n;
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
```

# Binary Search

Note that the key is to find an integer in the array **[1, 2,.., n]** instead of finding an integer in the **input array**.

We can use the binary search algorithm, each round we guess one number, then scan the input array, narrow the search range, and finally get the answer.

According to the **Pigeonhole Principle**, `n + 1` integers, placed in an array of length `n`, at least `1` integer will be repeated.

So guess a number first(the number `mid` in the valid range `[left, right]`), count the elements of the array which is less than or equal to `mid` in the array.

1. If `cnt` is strictly greater than `mid`. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, repeated elements are in the interval `[left, mid]`;
2. Otherwise, the repeated element is in the interval `[mid + 1, right]`.

With extra `O(1)` space, without modifying the input.

```java
    public static int findDuplicate_bs(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int low = 1;
        int high = len - 1;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                if (nums[i] <= mid) {
                    cnt++;
                }
            }

            if (cnt <= mid) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }
```

# Bit 

This method is convert all the numbers to **binary** numbers. If we can get **each digit** of the repeated number in binary, we can rebuild the repeated number.

Count all the bits of `[1, n]` and array numbers as `1` respectively, and then restore them bit by bit to get this repeated number.

For example, the `i`th digit, note that in the `nums` array, the sum of all the elements whose ith digit is `1` is `x` as convert the number to binary. 

As the range `[1, n]`, we can also count the sum of the number whose `i`th digit is `1`, we denoted it `y`.

We can easily get that `x > y`.

The following table lists whether each bit in the binary of each number is `1` or `0` and what the `x` and `y` of the corresponding bit are:

|	 	|    1   |    3   |    4   |    2   |    2   |    x   |    y   |
|:-----	| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Bit 0 |    1   |    1   |    0   |    0   |    0   |    2   |    2   |
| Bit 1 |    1   |    0   |    1   |    1   |    1   |    3   |    2   |
| Bit 2 |    0   |    0   |    1   |    0   |    0   |    1   |    1   |

From the table, we found that only the `1`th bit `x > y`, so after bitwise restoration `target=(010)_2=(2)_10`, which is the answer.

The proof of correctness is actually similar to method `1`. We can consider the change of the number `x` of the `i`-th in different example arrays.

- If `target` appears twice in the test case array, the rest of the numbers appear once, and the `i`th bit of `target` is `1`, then the `nums` array x, is exactly one greater than y. If bit `i` of `target` is `0`, then both are equal.

-  If `target` appears three or more times in the array of test cases, then there must be some numbers that are not in the `nums` array. At this time, it is equivalent to replacing these with `target`, we consider the impact on `x` when replacing:

	* If the `i`-th bit of the number to be replaced is `1`, and the `i`-th bit of `target` is `1`: `x` remains unchanged, `x > y`.
	
	* If the `i`-th bit of the number being replaced is `0`, and the `i`-th bit of `target` is `1`: x plus one, `x > y`.
	
	* If the i-th bit of the number to be replaced is `1`, and the `i`-th bit of `target` is `0`: `x` minus one, `x <= y`.
	
	* If the `i`-th bit of the number to be replaced is `0`, and the `i`-th bit of `target` is `0`: x remains unchanged, satisfying `x <= y`.

Therefore, if the ith bit of `target` is `1`, then after each replacement, only `x` will be unchanged or increased. If it is `0`, only `x` will be unchanged or decreased.

When `x > y`, the ith bit of `target` is `1`, otherwise it is `0`. We only need to restore this repeated number bitwise.

With extra `O(1)` space, without modifying the input.

```java
    public static int findDuplicate_bit(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int ans = 0;
        int bit_max = 31;
        while (((n - 1) >> bit_max) == 0) {
            bit_max -= 1;
        }

        for (int bit = 0; bit <= bit_max; ++bit) {
            int x = 0, y = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if ((nums[i] & (1 << bit)) != 0) {
                    x += 1;
                }
                if (i >= 1 && ((i & (1 << bit)) != 0)) {
                    y += 1;
                }
            }
            if (x > y) {
                ans |= 1 << bit;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
```

# Fast Slow Pointers
This problem is as same as [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/),  you can refer to this [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/discuss/1701055/JavaC%2B%2BPython-best-explanation-ever-happen's-for-this-problem) for the explanation of the slow fast pointer approach to solve this problem.

The key is to understand how to treat **the input array as a linked list**.

Take the array `[1,3,4,2]` as an example, the index of this array is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, we can map the index to the `nums[n]`.

```txt
0->1
1->3
2->4
3->2
```

Start from 0， use value  nums[n] as a new index, and so on, until the index exceeds the bounds. This produces a sequence similar to a linked list.

```txt
0->1->3->2->4->null
```

If there are a repeated numbers in the array, take the array `[1,3,4,2,2]` as an example, 

```txt
0->1
1->3
2->4
3->2
4->2
```

Similarly, a linked list is like that:

```txt
0->1->3->2->4->2->4->2->…
```

Here `2->4` is a cycle, then this linked list can be abstracted as the following figure:

With extra `O(1)` space, without modifying the input.

```java
    public int findDuplicate_fastSlow(int[] nums) {
        int slow = 0;
        int fast = 0;
        do {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        } while (slow != fast);

        slow = 0;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
```

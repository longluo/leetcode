# Lookup Table

$32$ bit signed integers only.

If we don't need to solve very large values and are time-sensitive, we can find all values in advance.

This function will work strictly in the case that we’re dealing with $32$ bit signed integers (which could be a constraint in languages like Java, C/C++, etc.)

The tribonacci sequence grows very quickly, which means that only the first **37** tribonacci numbers fit within the range of a $32$ bit signed integer.

This method requires only a quick list lookup to find the nth tribonacci number, so it runs in constant time. Since the list is of fixed length, this method runs in constant space as well.

```java
    int[] nums = {0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, 149, 274, 504, 927, 1705, 3136, 5768, 10609, 19513, 35890, 66012, 121415, 223317, 410744, 755476, 1389537, 2555757, 4700770, 8646064, 15902591, 29249425, 53798080, 98950096, 181997601, 334745777, 615693474, 1132436852, 2082876103};
    public int tribonacci(int n) {
        return nums[n];
    }
```

## Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(1)$.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$.
